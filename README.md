3. why modify the parameters in the contract without timelock and annoucement?
4. why did the moderator constantly remove the victims from official telegram group?
5. why did the team not contact the binance security team at the first place and other major swap/bridges on bsc to black hacker wallet address?
6. why did the team not report to korea police at the first place?
