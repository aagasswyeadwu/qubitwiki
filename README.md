2. why don't set bounty both for the hack and the people who helps us to find the hacker during the few days?
3. why don't audit all code before release to production like before? Why did the dev released the code with the knowledge the that the bridge part was not audited?
4. why modify the parameters in the contract without timelock and annoucement?
5. why did the moderator constantly remove the victims from official telegram group?
6. why did the team not contact the binance security team at the first place and other major swap/bridges on bsc to black hacker wallet address?
7. why did the team not report to korea police at the first place?
8. why did the team not stand out and solve the problems with victims together? And send only one customer service @moleh to remove most of victims?
